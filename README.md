# Background
A simple terminal-based, task-management software that allows anyone to keep track of their tasks. Users also receive reminders when tasks on their list are near their due date.

This project was my final project for Software Engineering 1 (CS 361) at Oregon State University. It was developed primarily with Python and utilizes a microservices architecture, meaning that each application/program does not directly interact with another, but rather communicates through pipes.
