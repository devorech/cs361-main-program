# Background
A simple terminal-based, task-management software that allows anyone to keep track of their tasks. Tasks can be added/removed from their to-do list, and recieve reminders when tasks on their list are near their due date. Completed tasks can be moved to the "completed" section and deleted afterwards.

This project was my final project for Software Engineering 1 (CS 361) at Oregon State University. It utilizes a microservices architecture, meaning that each application/program does not directly interact with another, but rather communicates through pipes.
